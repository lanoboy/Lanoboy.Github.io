**Lesson 4**

**Today I think that I succeeded very well in the task that was set and I also am very proud of myself and how I worked so I am very proud of myself. My group also help a me a lot. We as a group were progressing in the booklet towards coding the robot arm. I believe we all have the capability to code the robot arm but I know that it is very hard. We did delete part of the code halfway so that was a setback which affected the effectiveness of our lesson.**
