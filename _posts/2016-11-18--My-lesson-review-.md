  <tr>
    <td>I need to talk less to my peers as it distracts me from the task ahead but I should talk to them about the lesson work. Maybe trying to work more on my own rather that asking for help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will stick to the target at hand and not talk as much as it slowed down my work. Possibly help others more once I finish if they are struggling to do the work.</td>
