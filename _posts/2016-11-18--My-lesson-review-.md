**Lesson 2**

**Today I feel that me and my two partners , Jude and Abid have succeeded in the task that was set in class . We followed all of the rules in the booklet and we worked as a team to efficiently complete writing "hello world" .  I am very proud of our work and I am also very proud of myself as I did not expect myself to be as good as i am at fusebox . What I regret is that we as a team took quite long to figure it out but as we work through the weeks I hope we will get faster and more efficient but overall I feel me and Jude and Abid did a fabulous job at meeting the criteria .**
